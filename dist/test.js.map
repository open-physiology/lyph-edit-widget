When a new inner Observable is emitted, `switchMap`\n\t * stops emitting items from the earlier-emitted inner Observable and begins\n\t * emitting items from the new one. It continues to behave like this for\n\t * subsequent inner Observables.\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Rerun an interval Observable on every click event</caption>\n\t * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n\t * var result = clicks.switchMap((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n\t * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n\t *\n\t * @see {@link concatMap}\n\t * @see {@link exhaustMap}\n\t * @see {@link mergeMap}\n\t * @see {@link switch}\n\t * @see {@link switchMapTo}\n\t *\n\t * @param {function(value: T, ?index: number): Observable} project A function\n\t * that, when applied to an item emitted by the source Observable, returns an\n\t * Observable.\n\t * @param {function(outerValue: T, innerValue: I, outerIndex: number, innerIndex: number): any} [resultSelector]\n\t * A function to produce the value on the output Observable based on the values\n\t * and the indices of the source (outer) emission and the inner Observable\n\t * emission. The arguments passed to this function are:\n\t * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n\t * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n\t * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n\t * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n\t * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n\t * projected inner Observable.\n\t * @method switchMap\n\t * @owner Observable\n\t */\n\tfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n\t    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n\t}\n\texports.switchMap = switchMap;\n\tvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n\t    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n\t        return source._subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapOperator;\n\t}());\n\t/**\n\t * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n\t * @ignore\n\t * @extends {Ignored}\n\t */\n\tvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n\t    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n\t    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n\t        _super.call(this, destination);\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t        this.index = 0;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        var index = this.index++;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.project(value, index);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (error) {\n\t            this.destination.error(error);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (innerSubscription) {\n\t            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n\t        }\n\t        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.isUnsubscribed) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n\t        this.remove(innerSub);\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t        if (this.isStopped) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n\t        if (this.resultSelector) {\n\t            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (err) {\n\t            this.destination.error(err);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this.destination.next(result);\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n\t}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 92 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\texports.isArray = Array.isArray || (function (x) { return x && typeof x.length === 'number';
